## Motivation

### What is Base Station?
Base Station is the next generation DevOps Inspired IT Service Management Platform for Technology Teams.


### Start with WHY
Base Station was an idea that was developed over time after working for an international start-up where we were rapidly maturing and scaling our DevOps Capabilities with a very small team of engineers.  As we continued to climb we reached higher and higher plateaus… throughout this process we began to get greater perspective and see new challenges… (i.e. one more thing)

We got to a point of visibility where we wanted to begin working with Higher Levels of Abstraction to Orchestrate more Complex Workflows and Processes (Events, Activities, and Services) across our entire Platform Infrastructure… which included our Office and Datacenter Environments… as well as our Ops Environment which had grown to include quite a few DevOps focused apps and services… (Chef, Hubot, Consul, Sensu, Terraform, Nexus, Jenkins, etc)

We work primarily with Open Source Technology… which is what makes DevOps Great… and when looking at the OTS (off the shelf) Market and Community… we saw that there was something missing… a 100% open source platform that helps to seamlessly bring many of these capabilities together… and a platform that scales because it doesn't wind up costing you more than the infrastructure you are managing when you get out of the freemium tier.  (licenses by host, user, core, etc… yuck!)

We're designing Base Station for scalability and flexibility for teams to integrate Base Station easily with your existing DevOps solutions, and potentially even sunset a few. (<cough> <cough> Shitty Service Desk Platforms... <cough> <cough>)

Our Commitment...
* 100% Open Source full stack, components and features!
* DevOps inspired Features and Integrations that work in Real Time!
* We will hold nothing back... Base Station will Ship with Everything… Always!

### Who is Copyleft.io?
- A collection of technology Hobbyists and Professionals
- Like most Hobbyists we selfishly built Base Station primarily for ourselves, but we saw the immense value in it and wanted to share it with the community.
- Copyleft.io designs and builds 100% open source solutions.  We hold nothing back.  We ship everything.
- We provide Hosting, Support, and Consulting Services for teams wishing to take their game to the next level and would like the benefit of our experience with DevOps Automation, Infrastructure as a Service, Environment as a Service, and Cloud Based Architecture.
